# Train-Scheduler: Firebase Homework #7

This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data of trains. Using Moment.js the app will calculate when the next train will arrive relative to current time. In addition, it will calculate when the next train will arrive in minutes.

##  How to Use the App:

The admnistrators will need to enter the following data:

 - Train Name

 - Destination

 - First Train Time (using Military time)
 
 - Frequency (minutes)

After entering the data above, the fields "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" will auto populate.
